# Sustainable Fishing

Sustainable fishing is essential for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems and ensuring the long-term viability of fish populations. These practices are designed to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This concept aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #14, which aims to "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."

A key aspect of sustainable fishing is accurately monitoring fish populations to inform management decisions and support conservation efforts.

This project aims to address the limitations of manual fish counting by developing an automated system. Using machine learning and computer vision, the system will accurately count and classify fish.
